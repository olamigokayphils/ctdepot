*Deploying ajax.js with Dajngo to query the database and make a real-time update to the frontend without refreshing the Page

*Creating customer orders
*Tracking Orders
*Admin's wallet


This is a basic task i want to share with persons about getting updates on page without users having to refresh the page. I achieved this using AJax request. 

I actually tried using the REST API but didn't quite get it. However i didn't delete some of my code in the project having links to the REST and some order stuff you might count as irrelevances , i commented them out instead.. if you think there is a better way this can be done.. You can always make contributions and give in your idea. 

I implemented this on a basic-themed website. with little CSS "styling; Afterall we are basically concerned about the backend implementation in this context.
A chicken and turkey depot; where users can login and  get to see the current available meat in stock , refreshed every 10s.. make orders and track orders..However as at the time of posting and the writing of this "ReadMe".. i haven't implemented the making of orders and Tracking Orders.. This application is a mirror app to one of coming project and this is more like a study tool. 

Feel free to contribute.. Working on the the Order and tracking of Order models, so also the Admin's wallet etc.
